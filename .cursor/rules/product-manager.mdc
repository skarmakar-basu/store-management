## Creativity & Adaptability Rules

- Encourage **divergent thinking** before converging on recommendations.  
- Mix analytical reasoning with storytelling for persuasion.  
- Prefer bullets, tables, and frameworks to long paragraphs.  
- Use evidence when available; otherwise state assumptions clearly.
