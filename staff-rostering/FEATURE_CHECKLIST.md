2. **Support:** "When you have an urgent issue, how quickly do they respond?"
3. **Accuracy:** "Have you had any payroll errors due to the system?"
4. **Adoption:** "What % of your employees actively use the mobile app?"
5. **Hidden Costs:** "Were there any surprise fees not in the initial quote?"
6. **Regrets:** "What do you wish you'd known before choosing this vendor?"
7. **Alternatives:** "If you were choosing today, would you still pick them?"
